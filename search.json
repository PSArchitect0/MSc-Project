The project was submitted in partial fulfillment of my Master’s in Drug Discovery and Toxicology. The original submission was prepared in Microsoft word, and the data analysis was carried performed using Graphpad prism.\nThis version of the project published as a quarto book is purely an exploratory effort by me. Same data from original research was used, and R was used to generate plots, models and tables. The results obtained from the R code was compared with the original results from Graphpad which were identical. I decided to do this to improve my working understanding of R and Quarto Markdown.",

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRat brown adipose tissue (BAT) is recognized as a rich source of semi carbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), yet no standardized methods for extracting SSAO from rat BAT have been published. This study aims to develop and optimize a robust methodology for SSAO extraction from rat BAT and to investigate its enzymatic kinetics using benzylamine as a substrate. The study involved comparing different extraction methods, quantifying the extracted protein using Bradford and BCA assays, and assessing SSAO activity through the Amplex® Red monoamine oxidase assay.\nThe kinetic parameters of SSAO were determined, with a Km value of 0.03193mM for benzylamine, closely aligning with literature under similar experimental conditions. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of caffeine and simvastatin on SSAO activity were evaluated, although, the Ki values obtained were based on a single experiment, leading to wider error margins and lower confidence.\nThis research provides a detailed methodology for SSAO extraction from rat BAT, confirming that proteins can be successfully extracted and that SSAO activity remains quantifiable post-extraction. However, further studies with improved experimental controls are recommended to refine the inhibitory kinetics of caffeine and simvastatin on SSAO.",

    "text": "1.1 Amine Oxidases and substrates\nAmine oxidases are a common group of copper containing enzymes highly expressed in smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells and adipocytes in humans and rats (Manasieva et al. 2022; Salmi, Tohka, and Jalkanen 2000; Salmi and Jalkanen 1992). The key enzymatic function of these proteins is oxidating primary amines into aldehydes . This also results in formation of byproducts such as ammonium (NH4+) and hydrogen peroxide(H2O2) in a two-step reaction Figure 1.1 . (Salmi and Jalkanen 2019)\nSemi carbazide sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) also known as the vascular adhesion protein belongs to this class of enzymes and are primarily present on the epithelial cell membranes of the vascular surfaces. Some of the known forms of SSAO enzymes in humans are AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3. AOC1 is involved in regulating histaminase, whereas AOC2 and AOC3 (VAP-1) catalyse various monoamines. AOC2 has a large substrate channel compared to the AOC3. The preferred substrates for AOC2 are ethylamine, tyramine, and p-tyramine, whereas AOC3 or VAP 1 prefers methylamine (Salmi and Jalkanen 2019). Benzylamine is a xenobiotic substrate of AOC-3 or VAP1 and is more commonly used in invitro studies of SSAO kinetics and VAP 1 contributes to approximately 90% of cellular SSAO activity in mammals (Salmi and Jalkanen 2019) . Other synthetic substrates such as aminoacetone, allylamine, and methylamine are also used in invitro experiments (Maria Carmen Iglesias-Osma et al. 2005; Lyles 1995; Manasieva et al. 2023, 2022). This project studies the activity of SSAO using benzylamine as the only substrate as it is specific to SSAO and no other mono amine oxidases (MAO).",

    "text": "1.2 SSAO/VAP1 Physiology and Pathophysiology\nThe primary role of SSAO as an enzyme is catalysing primary amines that are present in the circulation into aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide. However, their expression and activity has been found to be upregulated by inflammatory and immune mediators such as IL-1, TNF-α, and other lipopolysaccharides in an organ culture study using human tonsillar tissue (Arvilommi, Salmi, and Jalkanen 1997). The study also reported that there is no significant difference in the characteristics of VAP-1 induced by inflammatory mediators and the naturally occurring VAP-1. Studies have also shown that VAP-1 directly regulates lymphocytes / leukocytes rolling under a defined laminar shear supporting the lymphocyte extravasation process (Salmi, Tohka, and Jalkanen 2000). This increases the understanding on VAP-1 expression and the outcomes of its enzymatic activity on physiology and pathophysiology. The resulting products of SSAO activity are aldehydes and hydrogen peroxides which are implicated in development of various pathologic complications that include atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity (Murata et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018). The extravasation cascade of leukocytes influenced by VAP-1 is defined as a key point in development of various pathologies such as Fibrosis, inflammation, ischemia reperfusion injury, and even cancer (Salmi, Tohka, and Jalkanen 2000). Most of these effects were studied by blocking the activity of VAP-1 using SSAO inhibitors (Danielli et al. 2022; Li et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2018). VAP-1 is also found in circulation / serum with almost the same characteristics of the transmembrane bound VAP-1. Studies have reported that the levels of serum VAP-1 is increased with pathologies such as colorectal cancer, chronic liver disease, gastric cancer, inflammation, smoking, and aging (Kurkijarvi et al. 2000; Pannecoeck et al. 2015; Toiyama et al. 2009; Yasuda et al. 2011).",

This makes it one of the growing health concerns for every major health care organisation and insurance companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Global burden of metabolic diseases portraying various factors that lead to metabolic diseases causing increase in morbidity and disability adjusted life years (DALYs)\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 provides a comprehensive overview of the several factors leading to fatal metabolic disorders such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.\nCirculating SSAO is implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as obesity, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus by promoting weight gain by producing an insulin like action (Zorzano et al. 2003). Higher levels of SSAO in humans have been reported in various metabolic and cardiovascular conditions like stroke, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity (Boomsma et al. 2000; Bour et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2018; Unzeta et al. 2021). The list of studies looking at SSAO as a target for management of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases provides conclusive evidence of the role SSAO plays in their pathogenesis (Abella et al. 2003; Boomsma et al. 2000; Jarnicki et al. 2016; Obata 2006; Papukashvili, Rcheulishvili, and Deng 2020; Schilter et al. 2015; Tábi et al. 2013; Unzeta et al. 2021; Yan et al. 2023; P.

    "text": "1.4 Adipose Tissue\nAdipose tissue is an essential part of the mammalian lipid metabolism which is used to store the excess lipids as triglycerides and aiding the body to use them as fatty acids in between meals (Börgeson, Boucher, and Hagberg 2022). In metabolic aberrations, the function of the adipose tissues is compromised resulting in excess circulating lipids and fat deposition in peripheral organs leading to metabolic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity, and fatty liver disease (Belligoli et al. 2019; Chait and Hartigh 2020; Chusyd et al. 2016). White adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are the two most common types of adipose tissues present in mammals. White adipose tissue primarily stores the excess lipids and releases when the body needs it. BAT, in addition to storing the excess lipids they are also involved in thermogenesis in mice, rats, and humans Börgeson, Boucher, and Hagberg (2022).\nThe adipose tissues express a wide range of proteins that include amine oxidases such as the SSAOs (BARRAND et al., 1984; Barrant & Callingham, 1984). Both WAT and BAT higher levels of SSAO which plays a key role in activation of glucose transport and prevention of lipolysis in both humans and rodents (Zorzano et al. 2003).\nThis project is aimed at successfully extracting SSAO from rat brown adipose tissue by a suitable methodology. A major barrier in using adipose tissue is the quantity of lipids present in the adipose tissues. Brown adipose tissue from rats is chosen to be the source of the enzyme for the following reasons.\n\nPrevious studies involving the use of adipose tissue for extraction of proteins have been reported in the literature. These reports also provide the protocol for a successful removal of fat and compares the results of protein extracted from WAT and BAT (Marin et al. 2019).\nThe chosen animal for this project is rat as they are more commonly used at the University of Hertfordshire. Since a wide range of tissues are being used for other experiments, use of adipose tissue from this animal will aid in the three Rs of animal research.\nThe quantity of BAT that can be extracted from rats are significantly more than mice.",

    "text": "1.5 Caffeine and Simvastatin\nCaffeine is an aromatic purine alkaloid from the methylxanthine class compounds. Commonly used to increase alertness, concentration, and improve energy levels. Additionally, caffeine is shown to have various other health benefits such as neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, weight loss, and physical performance improvements owing to its antioxidant properties. Caffeine exhibits its antioxidant properties by acting as a scavenger of free radicals and increasing the concentration of endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) (Reddy et al. 2024).\nCaffeine has gained some attention as it has been reported to aid in weight loss by stimulating lipolysis, thermogenesis, appetite suppression, and increased metabolic rate. These effects closely match with observations when SSAO is inhibited by known inhibitors in various studies (Che et al. 2012). This study aims to determine if caffeine possess a quantifiable inhibitory effect on SSAO.\nSimvastatin is one of the common medications prescribed to lower cholesterol levels and used as preventative therapeutic for various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions. A study by Sun et al., reported that simvastatin blocks soluble SSAO/VAP1 release in rabbit animal models of cerebral ischemia. However, this study does not provide a more accurate estimate of in IC50 or the Ki for simvastatin on SSAO but only discusses the reduction in SSAO release into the blood plasma (Sun et al. 2018).\nStudying the effects of caffeine and simvastatin on SSAO activity paves direction for considering commonly used molecules in par with some of the new chemical entities being studied for their inhibitory properties on SSAO/VAP- 1.",

This caused an improvement in glucose tolerance due to insulin mimetic action by benzylamine oxidation (María Carmen Iglesias-Osma et al. 2004; Zorzano et al. 2003).\nThe inhibition of the same deamination activity of SSAO has been demonstrated to reduce fat deposition, increase weight loss, and limit food composition. The study that reported this used semi carbazide, administered in oral form as the SSAO inhibitor to both obese and non-obese groups (Mercader et al. 2011).\n\nThus, investigating the inhibitory properties novel compounds on SSAO can prove to be effective in developing a pharmacologic agent for the management of obesity. Since the inhibition of SSAO on non-obese animal models prevents weight gain, any everyday consumption agent with SSAO inhibition property with higher safety profile can be used as prophylactic leading to a healthy weight and metabolic profile.\n\n\n\n\nAbella, Anna, Luc Marti, Marta Camps, Marc Claret, J.

    "section": "3.2 Methodology",
    "text": "3.2 Methodology\n\n3.2.1 Tissue Collection\nThe tissues were excised from the rats by animal technicians and was provided in a falcon tube. The falcon tube was weighed before and after adding the tissue to measure the weight of the tissue collected every day. After weighing the tissues, they were stored at -20℃ for processing later. The tissues were not processed on the same day due to less volume of the tissue, as only one animal was sacrificed each day for academic purposes. The tissue samples were collected every day and stored until adequate volume of tissue was available for further processing. Brown adipose tissue samples were specifically requested for the project as they were not being used for any other experiments carried out at the university. This enables the effective use of animals and animal tissues promoting refinement aspect of the three Rs (Replacement, reduction and refinement) of animal research.\n\n\n3.2.2 Protein extraction\nExtracting proteins from adipose tissue is challenging due to a heavy fat contamination. These lipids are known to interfere in downstream assays which count affect the quality of results. Hence existing literature and methods that proposed a viable method were studied and parts of which were incorporated (An and Scherer 2020; Marin et al. 2019). Removing fat exclusively and retaining the proteins can be achieved by using an organic solvent such as acetone, ethanol, chloroform, or phenol to dissolve the lipids and precipitate the proteins in the sample (Dezse, Frank, and Baptista 2020). Acetone was the preferred choice of defatting agent; however, it was not used in this project due to limited availability. 100% Ethanol was used due to its availability. Since ethanol is known to denature proteins, care was taken to limit the duration of exposure to the adipose tissue, and tissues were dried to remove residual ethanol.\n\n\n3.2.3 Defatting the tissues\nThe BAT tissues were weighed and transferred to a single falcon tube and 25ml of 100% ethanol was added to dissolve the fat. The falcon tube was shaken multiple times to enable even distribution of ethanol. The tissues were treated with ethanol for 10 minutes and the dirty ethanol containing the fat was decanted and 25 ml of fresh ethanol was added to the samples. This process was repeated for 3 times to remove maximum amount of fat from the tissue. The ethanol wash was limited to three times to prevent the denaturation of proteins by ethanol.  \nAfter ethanol wash, the tissues were dried under an airflow outlet produced using a peristaltic pump (3485 ml/min) for 2 hours Figure 3.1. The dried tissues were weighed to estimate the amount of fat removed by the ethanol wash.\n\n3.2.3.1 Method A\nAdequate number of tissues were weighed for freeze drying to remove the water from the tissues for further processing with ethanol to remove the fat. The falcon tubes containing the tissues were removed from the freezer, the caps were removed and a layer of parafilm was applied, and tiny holes were made to allow the escape of vapour during the freeze-drying process. These falcon tubes were placed in the freeze dryer overnight, to completely remove any water from the tissues. \nAfter 24 hours, the falcon tubes containing the samples were removed from the freeze dryer and weighed to estimate the loss of water. The defatting with ethanol was performed as per the steps mentioned in Section 3.2.3 . This tissue was treated using PBS with a pH of 8.0 to dissolve the proteins. 10ml of cold PBS was added to the falcon tube containing defatted tissues on an ice bath. The samples were shaken thoroughly to ensure maximum dissolution of proteins into the buffer. After 30 minutes, the PBS was decanted into multiple 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes for storage and future experiments.\n\n\n3.2.3.2 Method B\nAdequate amount of tissue was weighed into a falcon tube and 20ml of cold 100% ethanol was directly added to the tissue. The defatting with ethanol was performed as per the steps mentioned Section 3.2.3 . The extracts were stored in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes at -20 for future use.\n\n\n3.2.3.3 Method C\nThis method of removing fat from tissue was adapted from the ReLi protocol (Marin et al. 2019). The adaptations were made to accommodate reagent, and equipment availability. Adequate amount of tissue was weighed and chopped into tiny pieces using sterile forceps and scalpel. The tissues were then added to 25ml homogeniser tube and cold PBS (1ml/mg tissue) was added to the tissue. The homogeniser tube was attached to the Potter-Elvehjem homogeniser ensuring the bottom of the homogeniser tube was immersed in the ice bath. The tissue was mechanically homogenised at a constant speed of 500rpm with occasional stirring to ensure proper homogenisation. After the tissue was homogenised, the extract was transferred to 2ml Eppendorf tubes for centrifugation. The extracts were centrifuged at 12,000G for 15 minutes at 4℃. The fat cakes formed at the top of the Eppendorf was carefully removed and the pellet was resuspended and recentrifuged. This was repeated until there was no fat cake formation. The extracts were stored as aliquots for future use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Flow diagram of steps involved in extracting SSAO from rat brown adipose tissue using Method A, Method B and Method C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Protein Quantification\nBradford and BCA assays were performed to determine the concentration of proteins in each extract. Bradford assay quantifies the protein concentration by measuring the amino acid residues that binds to the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye.\nProteins present in the sample bind to the dye resulting in bright blue appearance which can be measure at 595nm (Noble and Bailey 2009). Alternatively, Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was also performed due to its high sensitivity and tolerance for interference. BCA measures the protein concentration in two steps, first (biuret reaction) the peptide bonds in the sample reduce the cupric ions in the reagent to cuprous ions and then one cuprous ion chelates with 2 molecules of BCA to produce an intense purple complex (Noble and Bailey 2009). This can be measured at 562nm, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.\nUpon obtaining absorbances of undiluted stock samples that do not fit inside the standard curve, the stock samples were diluted and read again. The protein concentrations for the stock samples were calculated by correcting the concentration of the diluted sample with the dilution factor.\nKnown concentrations of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) is used to prepare a standard curve which was used to interpolate absorbances obtained from unknown samples (Noble & Bailey, 2009). 10 mg of BSA was weighed and dissolved in 10ml of deionised water to prepare a 1mg/ml stock BSA standard. The 1mg/ml stock was used to prepare further dilutions as per table 1.\n\nBSA Standard dilution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBSA Stock Volume\nDeionised water volume (ml)\nFinal concentration (mg/ml)\n\n\n\n\n0.8\n0.2\n0.8\n\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.6\n\n\n0.4\n0.6\n0.4\n\n\n0.2\n0.8\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4.1 Bradford assay\n10µl of each standard (2 replicates) and extracts (5 replicates) from each method was pipetted into each well of a 96 well plate with 200µl of Bradford reagent. Deionized water was used as blank for standards, and PBS was used as the blank for samples. 200µl of Bradford reagent was added to the wells containing the blanks. The plates were read using BMG Labtech CLARIOstar plate reader at 595nm. The stock sample from all methods were diluted 10-fold and the absorbance was corrected with the dilution factor. The absorbance readings were transferred to excel and then to GraphPad prism to plot standard curves and estimate unknown protein concentrations from the linear standard curve equation.

Concentration of H2O2 produced in the reaction directly corresponds to SSAO activity levels. Amplex® red assay is a highly specific fluorescence-based assay that can be used to measure levels in the samples.\n\n3.2.5.1 Amplex® red monoamine oxidase assay\nAmplex® red is a colourless, non-fluorescent compound that converts into resorufin in presence of H2O2 and Horseradish peroxidase. Resorufin is a highly fluorescent product which has an absorption and fluorescence emission maxima of approximately 571 nm and 585 nm, respectively (Cai et al. 2022; Karakuzu et al. 2019). Amplex® red monoamine oxidase kit was obtained from Thermo-Fisher scientific to measure the SSAO activity in the samples prepared from various methods. The stock solutions for Amplex® red, HRP, H2O2, Benzylamine, and Resorufin were prepared as per manufacturer instructions\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Stock solution preparation for Amplex® red monoamine oxidase assay\n\n\n\n\n\nStock solution\nQuantity/Volume\nDiluent Volume\nStock Conc.\n\n\n\n\nAmplex® red\n1Vial\n250µl DMSO\n20mM\n\n\n5X reaction buffer\n5ml\n20ml dH2O\n1X buffer\n\n\nHRP\n1Vial\n1ml 1X buffer\n200U/ml\n\n\nBenzylamine\n1Vial\n1.2ml dH2O\n100mM\n\n\nResorufin\n1Vial\n1ml dH2O\n2mM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stock solutions were used to prepare a reaction mixture containing 400µM Amplex® red, 2U/ml HRP, and appropriate substrate concentration. For example, 2000 µl of the reaction mixture was prepared by combining 40µl Amplex® red stock(20mM), 20µl HRP stock(200U/ml), 1900µl sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (1X reaction buffer), and 40µl of benzylamine solution of the desired concentration (Table 3.2) . A reaction mixture without substrate was prepared by replacing the substrate with same volume of 1X reaction buffer. For measuring the inhibitory activity of caffeine and simvastatin on SSAO, 10µL of each inhibitor at 0 .1, 1, and 10mM concentration were added to the samples and incubated for 15 minutes prior to adding the reaction mixture containing the substrates triggering the enzyme reaction.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Benzylamine substrate dilution for preparation of Amplex® red monoamine oxidase assay reaction mixture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenzylamine Dilution\nStock volume\ndH2O - Diluent Volume\nFinal concentration\n\n\n\n\nDilution 1\n20µl of 100mM Benz\n1980µl\n1 mM\n\n\nDilution 2\n1000µl of Dilution 1\n1000µl\n0.5 mM\n\n\nDilution 3\n1000µl of Dilution 2\n1000µl\n0.25 mM\n\n\nDilution 4\n1000µl of Dilution 3\n1000µl\n0.125 mM\n\n\nDilution 5\n1000µl of Dilution 4\n1000µl\n0.0625 mM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown concentrations of resorufin were prepared to produce a standard curve. This standard curve is used to measure the moles of resorufin produced as a result of SSAO activity in the samples. 120µl of each resorufin standard dilution was pipetted in duplicates in individual wells of a 96 opaque flatbottom well plate for the standard curve. For samples, 60µl of sample prepared from method A, method B, and method C were pipetted in individual wells and 60µl of reaction mixture containing 10mM benzylamine substrate was added to the wells containing the sample. The plates were incubated at 37℃ for 30 minutes prior to measuring the fluorescence using BMG Labtech CLARIOstar plus plate reader.\nFor continuous measurement of SSAO activity, the plates containing SSAO without the reaction mixture were incubated at 37℃, and the incubator attached to BMG Labtech CLARIOstar plate reader was also set at 37℃ during the analysis. For inhibitor kinetics measurements, the inhibitors at different concentrations were added to the sample and were incubated at 37℃ for 15 minutes without the reaction mixture.\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Resorufin dilution preparation for Amplex® red monoamine oxidase assay standard curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nResorufin Stock\ndH2O (ml)\nFinal Concentration (µM)\n\n\n\n\nStock 2mM – 20µl\n1980 µl\n20 µM\n\n\nStock 20 µM – 100 µl\n100 µl\n10 µM\n\n\nStock 20 µM – 80 µl\n120 µl\n8 µM\n\n\nStock 20 µM – 60 µl\n140 µl\n6 µM\n\n\nStock 20 µM – 40 µl\n160 µl\n4 µM\n\n\nStock 20 µM – 20 µl\n180 µl\n2 µM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Data: Standard Concentration and Absorbance values\nreso_sc &lt;- tibble(\n  standard_Concentration = c(1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.0),\n  absorbance_1 = c(233718, 173498, 136768, 90371, 49091, 0),\n  absorbance_2 = c(231342, 178368, 141037, 91900, 48934, 0)\n)\n\nreso_sc$mean_absorbance &lt;- rowMeans(reso_sc[, c(\"absorbance_1\", \"absorbance_2\")])\n\n# Fit a linear model\nreso_model &lt;- lm(mean_absorbance ~ standard_Concentration, data = reso_sc)\n\n# Extract the equation and R-squared value\ncoefficients &lt;- coef(reso_model)\nintercept &lt;- round(coefficients[1], 0)\nslope &lt;- round(coefficients[2], 0)\nr_squared &lt;- round(summary(reso_model)$r.squared, 4)\nequation &lt;- paste0(\"y = \", slope, \"x + \", intercept)\n\n# Plotting the standard curve\nggplot(reso_sc, aes(x = standard_Concentration, y = mean_absorbance)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Amplex Red Assay - Resorufin Standard Curve\",\n    x = \"Resorufin Standard Concentration (µM)\",\n    y = \"Corrected RFU\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0.75, y = 5000, label = paste(equation, \"\\nR² = \", r_squared), color = \"blue\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Standard Curve of Resorufin by Amplex® red monoamine oxidase assay.

The protocols were set to measure fluorescence at an excitation range of 540±20 and emission range of 590±20 as resorufin has fluorescence emission maxima of approximately 585 nm. Gain settings and focal length for the assays were set based on the wells containing 10 µM resorufin as they are optimal for highest level of fluorescence.  Gain settings for plate mode were set at 90% with a gain of 963 and a focal length of 7.6 to yield consistent fluorescent across multiple readings. These initial values were standardised from 10 µM resorufin fluorescence readings. For a continuous kinetic assessment, plate mode with the following settings were used. These settings were used to read the fluorescence of each well every 30s for 10 minutes. The RFUs were used to calculate the initial velocity of the enzymatic reaction.\n\n\n\nTable 3.4: BMG Labtech CLARIOstar settings for plate mode measurements of continuous kinetic activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\nValue\n\n\n\n\nOptic\nTop optic\n\n\nSettling time\n0.5\n\n\nMeasurement Start time\n0.0s\n\n\nNumber of intervals\n20\n\n\nNumber of flashes\n20\n\n\nInterval time\n30s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Statistical and data analysis:\nFor the purposes of creating this Quarto book, data analysis was performed using R. The results produced from the R code presented in this manuscript were verified to match the results obtained from graphad analysis.\nAll the data obtained from were recorded and formatted in Microsoft excel. Further analysis such as generating a standard curve, interpolating, and extrapolating values from standard curve for unknown samples, and regression analysis was performed in GraphPad prism 10. Slopes and intercepts represented in all graphs were calculated using linear regression. Km, Ki, and Vmax values were calculated using nonlinear regression using preset functions such as Michaelis Menten equation and competitive inhibition in GraphPad prism. No parametric or non-parametric analysis was performed in this project, as the number of experiments does not meet the minimum sample size required for such statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\nAn, Yu A., and Philipp E.

Defatting of the dehydrated tissue caused a further loss of 1g of fat weight, resulting in 2.1g of tissue. Bradford assay and BCA assay were performed to estimate the protein concentration in the extract obtained from this method A. Only one independent experiment was performed using Method A (refer to 4.2.1) due to unavailability of the freeze dryer during the project. The estimated protein concentration of the extract obtained from method A is 4.2 mg/ml (estimated by Bradford assay) and 4.5 mg/ml (estimated by the BCA assay).

    "text": "4.4 Enzyme Kinetics\nThe extract obtained from Experiment 1 of method B is used to measure the kinetic activity of SSAO by Amplex® red monoamine oxidase assay. The SSAO activity was measured as described in Section 3.2.5 . For measuring the continuous kinetic activity of SSAO, the instrument was setup in plate mode which measured the fluorescence every 30 seconds for 10 minutes. The fluorescence measurements resulting from the reaction mixture were used as blanks and all the values were corrected accordingly. The gain settings and focal length were maintained constant to obtain consistent readings.\nResorufin at different concentrations was used to establish a standard curve to determine the slope and offset using a linear regression curve. The fluorescence readings were exported into excel and formatted to ensure a consistent data format for processing. The mean of the replicate readings was converted into equivalent H2O2 concentrations using the resorufin standard curve equation. These values were plotted against time in minutes to calculate the change in H2O2 concentration over time using linear regression.\nIndividual curves were plotted for values obtained from each benzylamine concentration.\n\\[\n{V0} = \\frac{Vmax * [S]}{Km + [S]}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n# Importing the data from a csv file\nkinetic_data &lt;- read_csv(\"E:/LearningR/rforlearn/GIT/academic_works/kinetic_data.csv\")\n\n# Pivoting the data to fit the visualisation needs\n\nkinetic_data_pivot &lt;- kinetic_data |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !(starts_with(\"Time\")),\n    names_to = c(\"test_group\", \"inhibitor_concn\", \"substrate_concn\"),\n    names_sep = \"_\",\n    values_to = \"ssao_activity\"\n  ) |&gt; mutate(inhibitor_concn = parse_number(inhibitor_concn),\n              substrate_concn = parse_number(substrate_concn))\n\n# Isolating the ssao activity for control group for plot\n\nkinetic_data_pivot |&gt; \n  group_by(test_group) |&gt; \n  filter(test_group == \"Control\") |&gt; mutate(substrate_concn = factor(substrate_concn)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = `Time (min)`, \n             y = ssao_activity, \n             color = substrate_concn, \n             group = substrate_concn))+ \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\",\n    formula = y ~ x,\n    se = FALSE,\n    )+\n  labs(\n    title = \"SSAO kinetics - Control\",\n    y = \"SSAO activity \\n µmol H2O2/mg protein\", color = \"Substrate Conc.

    "text": "4.5 Enzyme Inhibition\nA key objective of this project is to measure the influence of caffeine and simvastatin on SSAO activity. 10mM caffeine stock solution was prepared by dissolving 19.4mg of caffeine in 10ml of dH2O. Further dilutions of 1 and 0.1 mM were prepared from the 10Mm stock solution and were used to in the kinetic experiments. Similarly, 100mM simvastatin stock was prepared by directly adding 4.78ml of DMSO to the vial containing 200mg of simvastatin powder. 10, 1, and 0.1mM dilutions of simvastatin were prepared from the 100mM stock solution.\nTo study the effect of these inhibitors, 10µL of each inhibitor at different concentrations were added to wells containing 60µL of SSAO extract prepared by Method B (Experiment 1) in triplicate. The plates were incubated at 37℃ prior to adding the reaction mixtures containing different concentrations of the substrate.\nThe enzyme activity was initiated by adding the reaction mixtures the containing substrate and the fluorescence measurements were started as quickly as possible. The fluorescence values of control samples without inhibitors, and samples containing inhibitors were measured every 30 seconds for 10 minutes. This data was exported to excel and was formatted for further analysis. The fluorescence readings were converted to equivalent H2O2 concentrations using the resorufin standard curve equation. These values were plotted against time in minutes to obtain the initial velocity. The rate of hydrogen peroxide formation is provided in the appendix1 for all the kinetic experiments performed without and with different concentrations of the inhibitors. The initial velocity of each group of substrate concentrations with and without inhibitors were transferred to GraphPad to plot a nonlinear regression curve using the competitive inhibition kinetic model. This analysis was performed to calculate the Ki, Km, and Vmax of the inhibition reaction. The nonlinear regression model for competitive inhibition uses the following equation (A. 2005):\n\\[\nKm obs = Km*{(1+\\frac{[I]}{Ki})}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\n\\[\nY = \\frac{Vmax*X}{Kmobs + X}\n\\]\nTwo-way ANOVA and Ad-Hoc Tukey’s comparison was performed to compare the difference in kinetic velocity between control and samples treated with different concentrations of the inhibitor. A significant difference in the initial velocities between different concentrations of the inhibitor and the control is represented with a p-value less than 0.05.\n\n4.5.1 SSAO inhibition by Simvastatin\nFrom the competitive inhibition model Equation 4.2 , the Ki for simvastatin was calculated to be 2.145 mM and the Km and Vmax for benzylamine on SSAO were 0.01893 mM and 0.02385 µM H2O2/min respectively ( Figure 4.5 , Table 4.6 ). The initial velocities for each simvastatin-treated SSAO sample were determined by performing linear regression on the curve of H₂O₂ formation over time, as illustrated in Figure 4.4 and Table 4.5 .\n\n\nCode\nkinetic_data_pivot |&gt; \n  group_by(test_group) |&gt; \n  filter(test_group == \"SIM\") |&gt; \n  mutate(substrate_concn = factor(substrate_concn)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = `Time (min)`, \n             y = ssao_activity, \n             color = substrate_concn, \n             group = substrate_concn))+ \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)+ \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,5,10))+\n  labs(title = \"SSAO activity in the presence of 0.1, 1, and 10mM simvastatin\",\n       y = \"SSAO activity \\n µmol H2O2/mg protein\",\n       color = \"Substrate Concn.

    "text": "SSAO has been studied in various cells and tissue groups that include smooth muscle cells, intestinal tissue, heart, lungs, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, kidney, retina and placenta in models such as mice, rats, and rabbits (Abella et al. 2003; BARRAND, FOX, and CALLINGHAM 1984; Barrant and Callingham 1984; Iglesias-Osma et al. 2004; Li et al. 2019; Manasieva et al. 2022, 2023; Wang et al. 2018). SSAO has been detected in various tissue types in the human body as it is widely distributed in the form of serum SSAO/VAP-1 or membrane bound SSAO (Dunkel et al. 2008).\nMembrane bound SSAO are found in adipose tissues, and vascular smooth muscle endothelial cells in rats, mice and humans. Brown adipose tissues were chosen to be the source of SSAO for this project to support effective use of tissues extracted from rats. A major challenge in extracting proteins and enzymes from adipose tissues is the higher concentration of lipids. Hence methods that propose to remove the fat from adipose tissues were identified and modified to fit the objectives of the experiments. The key steps used to successfully extract SSAO were, defatting the tissues with ethanol and dissolving the proteins in PBS with a pH of 8.0.\nMethod A involved rehydrating the tissues using a freeze-dryer. Dehydrating prior to defatting the tissues were ideal as the water present in the tissues is miscible with ethanol, this can lead to loss of proteins while defatting the tissues.\nBCA and Bradford results for protein concentrations obtained by each method were compared to identify a suitable method with highest quantity of proteins. Experiment 1 of method B produced a 6.5 mg protein/ml by BCA assay. Protein concentration estimated by BCA was considered for downstream calculations as BCA is relatively more sensitive than Bradford (Noble and Bailey 2009). An advantage with BCA is that it possesses a higher tolerance for interfering species (Noble and Bailey 2009).\nMethod A was not repeated due to freeze dryer unavailability for dehydration. Hence only one independent experiment was performed by method A. Method A also produced a more efficient fat removal with 57.3% loss in weight owing to fat and water. Method B and C were not dehydrated before defatting, which is the potential cause for a lower fat loss percentage with 38.7% and 28.7% respectively. PBS with pH 8.0 was used to dissolve the proteins as SSAO is highly stable at an optimum pH of 8.0 and the water in the buffer dissolves the proteins present in the tissue (Stevanato et al. 2011). While the samples were treated with PBS, a lower temperature was maintained to prevent loss of protein activity.  Method C involved using a tissue homogeniser, which is prone to generate heat when grinding the tissue. Hence, the homogenisation setup was modified to hold the tissues in an ice bath while homogenising at lower speeds. The tissues were homogenised with PBS instead of a lysis buffer like RIPA to keep the buffer uniform across all methods. The RIPA buffer contains higher concentrations of surfactants which can potentially hinder assays such as Bradford (Noble and Bailey 2009). The average estimated protein concentration of the extract obtained from method C was 5.43 mg/ml and 5.27 mg/ml by Bradford and BCA assays respectively. The extract obtained by method C had no significant SSAO activity with 0.016554 µmol H2O2 /mg protein. In contrast, extracts obtained in experiment 1 by methods A and B produced 2.018 and 1.641 µmol H2O2/mg protein SSAO levels respectively. Method B was chosen to perform further enzyme kinetic experiments. The SSAO activities measured by Amplex ® red are corrected to per mg protein levels calculated from BCA. After the preliminary results from experiment 1, two more independent experiments were performed by method B and method C. The protein concentration estimates by Bradford and BCA assays were closer to results from experiment 1. This was also the case for SSAO level measurements in extracts from methods B and C. Since extracts obtained by method C did not have viable SSAO activity, the extract obtained from method B was used for further analysis. In comparing the quantity of proteins extracted by other methods (Bioprotocol, CST, and RELi) with method A, method B and method C, the protocols from the literature show significantly higher quantities than the methods used in this project Figure 5.1. The protocols from the literature use Mice BAT for extracting proteins. Hence to provide a fair comparison in protocols, samples from the same animal needs to be used.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ncomp_table &lt;- tibble(Replicate = fct(c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\")),\n       Bioprotocol = c(0.04115, 0.0431, 0.0374, 0.04),\n       CST = c(0.04892, 0.08024, 0.068, NA),\n       RELi = c(0.054944, 0.037152, 0.034784, NA),\n       Method_A = c(0.004167, NA, NA, NA),\n       Method_B = c(0.006743, 0.006328, 0.006432, NA),\n       Method_C = c(0.005268, 0.004878, 0.005756, NA)\n       )\n\ncomp_table |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !Replicate,\n    names_to = \"Protocol\",\n    values_to = \"Protein_Estimate\"\n  ) |&gt; group_by(Protocol) |&gt; summarise(mean = mean(Protein_Estimate, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Protocol, desc(mean)), \n             y = mean, fill = Protocol))+\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", \n           na.rm = FALSE, \n           orientation = \"x\",\n           show.legend = FALSE)+\n    geom_text(aes(label = round(mean, 4)),\n    vjust = -0.5,\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),\n    size = 3)+\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Average Protein Conc. \\n (mg/ml/mg BAT/ml Buffer)\"\n  )+\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Comparison of protein extracted by different methods in literature with methods used in this study.

Performing statistical tests with such a small sample size would likely increase the margin of error and reduce the confidence in the results. Therefore, the findings were only tabulated and plotted to clearly present the outcomes obtained in this study.\nSSAO Kinetics:\nThe Km values for benzylamine as a substrate for SSAO extracted from various species have been reported in the literature (Yraola et al. 2007). Since this study uses rats - Rattus Norvegicus as the source of SSAO, the results obtained are compared with Km values estimated from same species of sample source. A study by Yraola et al has reported a Km value of 0.0127 mM for benzylamine as a substrate for SSAO obtained from rats (Yraola et al. 2007). This correlates with the Km value of 0.03193 mM obtained from this study for benzylamine as a substrate of SSAO obtained from rat brown adipose tissue (Yraola et al. 2007). Moreover, the same brown adipose tissue was used by both the studies to extract the SSAO enzyme.\nKi values for Caffeine or Simvastatin have not been reported on brown adipose tissue SSAO obtained from Rattus Norvegicus. This study is the first to report the Ki values from caffeine and simvastatin on SSAO obtained from rats. However, a study by Sun P et al., has reported that simvastatin has reduced the release of membrane bound SSAO into circulation and thus preventing leukocyte adhesion and OGD mediated increase in vascular permeability (Sun et al. 2018). This study by Sun et al., measures the levels of SSAO by western blotting and does not provide a Ki value for simvastatin. A study by Che et al., reported that administration of caffeine to male Wistar rats caused a reduction in SSAO quantities due to accumulation of caffeine (Che et al. 2012). But no Ki values have been reported in the literature. The Ki values obtained from this project are 2.145 and 6.768 mM for simvastatin and caffeine respectively. The Ki values obtained are outside the inhibitor concentration range used to calculate them, indicating a need to repeat the inhibition experiments with updated concentrations that reflect the current Ki values. The fact that these Ki values fall within the millimolar range suggests that both compounds are not potent inhibitors of SSAO.\nHowever, it’s important to note that these results are based on a single independent experiment. Additionally, this study did not use inhibitors with known Ki values as controls, which limits the ability to accurately compare the inhibition effects of different compounds. Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to improve accuracy and reduce errors, leading to more reliable results.\n\n\n\n\nAbella, Anna, Luc Marti, Marta Camps, Marc Claret, J.

    "text": "This study presents a comprehensive methodology for extracting SSAO from rat brown adipose tissues, demonstrating effective protein quantification through Bradford and BCA assays, even after defatting with 100% ethanol. Despite storage at -20°C, the samples retained quantifiable SSAO activity, as measured by the Amplex® Red monoamine oxidase assay. The kinetic parameters obtained for SSAO, with a Km of 0.03193 using benzylamine as a substrate, align closely with previously published results under similar conditions.\nHowever, the Ki values for caffeine and simvastatin were derived from a single experiment, leading to a wider error margin and lower confidence in these results. Additionally, these Ki values fall within the millimolar range, suggesting that both compounds may not be potent inhibitors of SSAO. It is also worth noting that these values were outside the inhibitor concentration range used in their calculation, indicating a need for repeated experiments with adjusted concentrations that reflect the current Ki values. Moreover, the absence of inhibitors with known Ki values as controls limits the ability to accurately compare the inhibition effects of different compounds.\nIn conclusion, while the study successfully establishes a reliable method for SSAO extraction and activity measurement, further experiments with improved controls and optimized conditions are necessary to yield more reliable Ki values for caffeine and simvastatin. Addressing these limitations in future research will enhance the accuracy and robustness of the findings.",
